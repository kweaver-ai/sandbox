### ⚠️ Partially Implemented

| Component | Status | Gaps | Priority |
|-----------|--------|------|----------|
| **Container Monitoring** | ⚠️ Basic only | No Prometheus metrics, no detailed health probing | P2 |
| **Template System** | ⚠️ CRUD only | No advanced features (versioning, dependencies) | P2 |
| **Web Console** | ⚠️ Basic only | Limited session management features | P2 |

### ❌ Not Implemented (Prioritized)

| Component | Business Impact | Priority | Est. Effort |
|-----------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Security Hardening** | Rate limiting, audit logging missing | P1 | 3-5 days |
| **Prometheus Metrics** | No observability integration | **P2 (Lowest)** | 3-5 days |
| **Template Pre-installed Packages** | Common packages in templates (deferred) | P2 | 1 week |

### Deferred (Not Planned)

| Component | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| **Multi-language Support** | Python only - satisfies current requirements |
| **CLI Tool (sandbox-run)** | Lower priority, can be added on demand |
| **Agent SDK** | Lower priority, can be added on demand |
| **Warm Pool** | Removed based on user feedback |

---

## 2. Roadmap Phases

> **Priority Notes** (from user):
> - Python execution is the primary focus (multi-language support deprioritized)
> - **Docker + K8s Runtime support is HIGH PRIORITY**
> - **Python dependency installation (pip install) is HIGH PRIORITY** - implementation approach TBD
> - SDK/CLI tools are lower priority
> - Warm Pool removed (not implementing)
> - Observability is lowest priority
> - File lifecycle tied to session lifecycle
